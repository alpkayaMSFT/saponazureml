Apply Azure Machine Learning to SAP Financials - AR data specifically in this case

How can Finance professionals better manage cash flows and optmize cash flow in general?

If you can garner insights on if a customer will pay balances on time (if so when?) on the companies Accounts Receivable, then better cash flow decisions can be made.  This is the business use case.  How can we apply AI/ML on predicting if a balance will be on time or not and lastly, when will a customer actually make the payment?

We will use an anonymised accounts receivable file that has balances, invoice dates, and settlement dates to apply our knowledge. We will use Azure Auto ML to run through this scenario
